This is your space to suggest sessions (that you either want to lead or see others lead) and to vote for your favorites. Although the majority of the schedule will still be created on site during TCamp13, the most popular events from this forum will become the first sessions on Day One of the Camp. Voting will close 2 days before Camp starts and folks will be notified in advance if their session made it into the starting block."
